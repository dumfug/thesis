\section{Graph Theory Basics}

In this section some graph theory related notation is defined which is used during this thesis.
A graph is a mathematical construct that can be used to model and explore the relationship between objects. 
More formally, a graph \cite{Thulasiraman1992} is a ordered pair of finite sets \(G = (V, E)\), whereas \(V\) denotes the set of \emph{vertices} (i.e., the objects) and \(E \subseteq [V]^2 \) the set of \emph{edges} (i.e., the relationships between the objects).
It is common to write \(V(G)\) and \(E(G)\) to refer to the set of vertices, respectively the set of edges, that are associated with a graph \(G\).
An edge \(\{v_1, v_2\} \in E(G)\) is an unordered pair of two vertices.
This means that there is not distinction between the two edges \(\{v_1, v_2 \}\) and \(\{v_2, v_1\}\). 
A graph with this property is called a \emph{undirected} graph.
However, it is also possible to define edges as ordered pairs, so that each edge does have a start- and endpoint. 
Such a graph is called a \emph{directed} graph.
An edge of the form \(\{v_i, v_i\} \in E(G)\) is called a \emph{self-loop} of the vertex \(v_i\).
Furthermore, it is possible that two distinct vertices are joined by multiple edges. 
Such edges are referred to as \emph{parallel} edges.
A graph that has no parallel edges and no self-loops is denoted as a \emph{simple} graph.
Figure \ref{fig:example_graphs} depicts two examples for graphs.

The \emph{order} of a graph is the number of vertices (i.e., the cardinality of the vertex set) and is denoted as \(n = |V|\).
