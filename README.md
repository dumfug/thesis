# Introducing Peer Influence Mechanisms into Activity-driven Network Generators

## Abstract

Time-varying networks open up the possibility to explore dynamical systems with respect to their temporal dimension in a more precise way.
One class of these systems that is particularly interesting are networks of human interactions.
They are characterized by the complex bursty patterns of human behavior.
The recent introduction of the activity-driven time-varying network framework led to an increased effort to model such social systems more accurately.
However, all of these approaches rely solely on intrinsic activity patterns of individuals and disregard possible external influences entirely.
In this thesis we propose an activity-driven network model by introducing a peer influence mechanism into the network dynamics.
Thus, we allow for individuals to motivate their neighbors in the social network to become active as well.
We examine the ramifications of this mechanism on the topological and activity-related properties of synthetically generated networks and reveal its complex influence on the dynamics.
Furthermore, our results indicate a positive effect on the emerging activity patterns.
